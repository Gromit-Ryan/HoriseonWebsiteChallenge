# Module1-Challenge Horiseon Website Challenge
# In this challenge we were given a code that didn't meet accessibility standards and to change the code until it met the acceptance criteria.
# This included adding alt attributes to the images, making sure the heading attributes were in sequential order, making sure the title had a descriptive title, and that semantic HTML elements were used.
